In this workshop we were introduced to the basics of inheritance. Like every other concept in C++ the basics are always understandable but as we going forward in these concepts and mixing them with each other it becomes more and more hard to understand. 
The most challenging part in this ws, was understanding initiation area and and setting cout . The fact that child inherits all the attributes even the private one but can not have access to them unless with a protected or public method was sth that I needed more explanation , and I got it in the calss!
