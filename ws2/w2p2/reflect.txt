I gained more knowledge about dynamic memory allocation, function overloading, and using references during the workshop. To manage memory for arrays while my application was running, I used dynamic memory allocation, which made memory management more flexible. I might have numerous functions with the same name but various uses for them depending on the arguments provided thanks to function overloading.

I also comprehended how references function. They enable me to access variables more quickly and without duplicating information. This made my programme run more quickly and efficiently use memory.

I also learned about the "out" parameter. A function may return many values thanks to this. Unlike other options, the "out" parameter sends data back to the calling code. It gives me the ability to change a parameter's value and then give the caller the new value. If I need to modify a parameter without directly returning it or return a range of values, this is useful.
