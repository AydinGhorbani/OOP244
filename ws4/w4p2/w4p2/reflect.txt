By studying the workshop solutions and reviewing the course notes, I solidified my understanding of constructors, destructors, dynamic memory allocation, and objects. Constructors are special functions used to initialize objects when they are created, and I learned about constructor overloading and the importance of initialization lists. Destructors, on the other hand, release resources allocated by objects, such as memory or file handles. I gained a deeper understanding of dynamic memory allocation, using new to allocate memory at runtime and delete to deallocate it, ensuring proper memory management. Objects, as instances of classes, encapsulate data and behavior, and I grasped their significance in modeling real-world entities. Overall, this review enhanced my knowledge of these fundamental concepts, allowing me to develop more robust and efficient object-oriented programs.
